● Dataset preparation: the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets were selected for experiments and model training. \\
● Model construction: Using the TensorFlow framework, several deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were constructed to replicate the experimental setup in the paper.\\
● Adversarial Example Generation: Implemented the Fast Gradient Symbol Method (FGSM) and successfully generated adversarial examples to test and improve the robustness of the models.
● Adversarial Training: The model was trained by combining the generated adversarial examples with the original data to improve its resistance to adversarial attacks.
● Model Evaluation: the performance of the different models was evaluated on a test set, with a particular focus on the classification accuracy of the adversarial examples.
● Performance analysis: the performance of different models before and after adversarial training was compared, focusing on analyzing the impact of adversarial training on model robustness.
